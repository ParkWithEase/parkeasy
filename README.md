# ParkEasy

## Project Description

**ParkEasy** is a multi-platform application that connects people needing a parking spot with people who own a parking spot. It allows the bookers to book a spot in just a tap of finger at competitive rates and provides owners a way to harness their vacant parking spots to generate passive income. **ParkEasy** is envisioned to be used as a mobile application and a web application. This application is designed for 2 categories of users, booker and seller.
