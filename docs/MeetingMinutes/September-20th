## Discussion

1. Got roasted during the meeting, all good advice though.
2. Change SQlite to Postgres
3. TA mentioned PWA, does that fit our project requirement? Need to ask Rob
4. Add non-functional feature:
   1. login/signup
   2. authentication using session token. (not JWT because this https://ianlondon.github.io/posts/dont-use-jwts-for-sessions/)
   3. Password reset with token
5. The current way to represent a listing is not efficient because it doesn't work well with time slot. We can do better
6. Github is setup (Kudos to Hieu)
7. What API do we need:  
   GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE for parking spot `/spots`  
   POST/GET/UPDATE for user `/user`  
   GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE for cars list per user `/users/{id}/cars`  
   GET/POST for booking `/spots/booking` (yse, booking is a noun)
   GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE for listing `/spots/listing`
8. Bidding should only keep the highest bidder with no fall back

## Action Item

1. Hritik: confirm whether PWA is valid with Rob
2. Update architecture diagram
3. Edwin to design android app
