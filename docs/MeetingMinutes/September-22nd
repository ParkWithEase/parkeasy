## Agenda

1. Iron Domain object

4. more API
5. Assign issues to everyone

## Discussion

1. listing is represented as a list of time segment, each time segment is 30 minutes.
2. We use a trunk branching strategy. Branch from main, make small branch, commit often, merge often. Squash commits before merging
3. API is good to go for the time being.
4. authentication explaination:  
   Authentication is a middle ware. The server doesn't care how it is implemented, just need to know if some one is in fact authenticated. User try to request server, if that is a protected route, server will redirect them to `/auth` endpoint if there is no or invalid session token in the cookie.
5. No need to have different column for forAuction Boolean, we have a view to calculate that
6. Issue assigned, see git
